## Overview
The Events project is a practical application of React.js and Next.js concepts. It focuses on creating a platform to display various events with filtering options. Dynamic routes are used to filter events by date.

## Core Concepts and Features
The **Events** project encompasses the following key elements:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilizing React.js, the project adopts a modular structure with components designed for reusability.

- **Props and State Management**: Effective management of component properties (props) and state is maintained for smooth data flow within the application.

- **Multi-Page Architecture**: Employing Next.js, the application consists of multiple pages for seamless navigation.

- **Dynamic Route Handling**: Next.js dynamic routing is used for event filtering, accessible via `/events/yyyy/m`.

- **Styling with module.css**: Styling is structured using module.css, preventing style conflicts.

- **Big Project File Structure**: The project follows an organized structure where significant components have dedicated folders, each containing smaller components catering to specific functions.


## Technical Setup 
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/events-react-nextjs.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd events-react-nextjs`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
- Access the event listing page at `/events`.
- Click on an event to view its details on the event details page.
