## Overview
The Events project is a practical application of React.js and Next.js concepts. It focuses on creating a platform to display various events with filtering options. Dynamic routes are used to filter events by date.

## Core Concepts and Features

The **Events** project embarks on a technical voyage, demonstrating proficiency in several pivotal domains:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: This project embodies the essence of React.js by employing a meticulously crafted component-based architecture. Components are elegantly structured, fostering reusability and maintainability.

- **Props and State Management**: Effective management of component properties (props) and state remains a cornerstone. The project underscores the significance of maintaining a fluid data flow within the application.

- **Multi-Page Architecture**: The application's structure embraces the tenets of Next.js, enabling a seamless navigation experience across multiple pages. This fluid transition enriches the user experience.

- **Dynamic Route Handling**: One of the project's highlights is its adept usage of Next.js's dynamic routing capabilities. The innovative implementation of dynamic routes in the format `/events/yyyy/mm` allows the user to dynamically filter and display events based on date.

- **Styling with module.css**: The visual identity of the application is meticulously sculpted using module.css. This approach encapsulates styles at the component level, mitigating unintended style interferences and advocating a structured styling paradigm.

- **Big Project File Structure**: A pioneering endeavor has been undertaken to adopt an expansive project file structure. This structure involves housing significant components within dedicated folders. Each of these significant components boasts its own ecosystem of subfolders housing smaller components exclusively tailored for the larger component's scope. For instance:
    - `events` (main folder)
        - `error-alert` (subfolder)
        - `event-details` (subfolder)
        - `event-list` (subfolder)
        - `events-search` (subfolder)

## Technical Setup 
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/events-react-nextjs.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd events-react-nextjs`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
- Access the event listing page at `/events`.
- Click on an event to view its details on the event details page.
- Use the filtering functionality by accessing `/events/yyyy/mm` to see events for a specific year and month.
