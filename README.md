## Overview
The Events project is a practical application of React.js and Next.js concepts. It focuses on creating a platform to display various events with filtering options. Dynamic routes are used to filter events by date.

### Core Concepts and Features
The **Events** project encompasses the following key elements:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilizing React.js, the project adopts a modular structure with components designed for reusability.

- **Props and State Management**: Effective management of component properties (props) and state is maintained for smooth data flow within the application.

- **Pre-rendering**: Utilizing Next.js's pre-rendering for improved performance.

- **Multi-Page Architecture**: Employing Next.js, the application consists of multiple pages for seamless navigation.

- **Dynamic Route Handling**: Next.js dynamic routing is used for event filtering, accessible via `/events/yyyy/m`.

- **Styling with module.css**: Styling is structured using module.css, preventing style conflicts.

- **Big Project File Structure**: The project follows an organized structure where significant components have dedicated folders, each containing smaller components catering to specific functions.

## Technical Setup 
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/eyyminda/events-react-nextjs.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd events-project`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
- Access the event listing page at `/events`.
- Click on an event to view its details on the event details page.
- Use the filtering functionality by accessing `/events/yyyy/m` to see events for a specific year and month.

### Additional Topics
The project extends beyond the core concepts to cover more advanced areas:

- **Client Fetching from Firebase DB**: Fetching data from a Firebase database on the client side.
- **Local API Routes**: Implementing local API routes for enhanced data communication.
- **Newsletter Registration Flow**: Demonstrating a user registration flow for newsletters.
- **Commenting and Viewing Comments**: Incorporating a comment system with the ability to view and interact with comments from a database.
